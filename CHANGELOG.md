## 1.0.0 (2026-01-04)
This is the initial release of opencv-ruby, which wraps the OpenCV library (version 4.11). It provides access to almost all of OpenCV's APIs except CUDA support (which may be added in the future). Please see the [documentation](https://cfis.github.io/opencv-ruby/) to get started.
